# Blender-Themes
any Blender themes I either created or modified

3.1 themes may also work on 2.9.x, but no guarantees.

_Nord Pro Scarlet_ is based on the [Nord Dark theme](https://github.com/TehMerow/Blender_Nord_Dark_Theme) for Blender and heavily modified. I might make other colour variants in the future.

December Dawn is made from scratch using Blender Light as a base. Some parts are still in progress, but the key features (node editor, properties, outliner) should be fully themed.

I recommend changing your Blender font, as the default font doesn't really do these themes justice. Free recommendations are Inter, Work Sans, Red Hat Text and Cantarell; the one I personally use is Graphik.
